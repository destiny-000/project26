Recipe for the VANILLA CAKE


First, measure and keep all the ingredients ready. To a bowl, add the curd + vinegar + baking soda and mix well. Curd and baking soda react with each other and now you can see bubbles arising on top. Set the mixture aside for 5 minutes only.
Sieve the maida, baking powder and salt twice.
To another bowl, pour the oil and water.
To the oil-water mixture, pour the curd + vinegar + baking soda mixture. Then add the vanilla essence and whisk it.
To the sieved dry ingredients pour the wet ingredients. Whisk everything without any lumps. By the meantime pre-heat the oven for 15 minutes. Brush a aking tray with oil and dust a little flour all over. Now pour the cake batter to the tray, then shake a little, so that the air bubbles release.
For the icing : keep the cream, powdered sugar and vanilla essence ready. Then transfer everything to a mixing bowl. Using a hand whisk or eletric whipper, whip it in high speed for 3 minutes until the cream reaches stiff peak consistency.
For the sugar syrup : to a bowl add 2 tbsp of sugar and warm water. Mix well till the sugar dissolves completely. Then pour little sugar syrup over the bottom layer and cover it with icing.
Now cover the bottom layer with another sliced cake. Brush it with the sugar syrup followed by icing on the top and sides too. You can also add some food colour in the icing. Finally put the sprinkles all over the cake.
Enjoy the VANILLA CAKE!
